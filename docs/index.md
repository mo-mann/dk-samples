title: Docker and Kubernetes Samples
---

This repository contains samples used to demonstrate concepts of docker standalone, docker swarm mode, and kubernetes.

For all samples, we will try to provide versions for Linux and Windows, with the Linux samples being created first. For all orchestration samples, we will try to provide versions on docker swarm mode and kubernetes, with the swarm mode samples being created first.

We try to follow git flow. The master branch contains "final" code; active development happens in the "development" branch.

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork and send pull requests.

## List of samples

More coming.
